# DataDrivenAcoustics.jl

Conventional acoustic propagation models require accurate environmental knowledge to be available beforehand. While data-driven techniques might allow us to model acoustic propagation without the need for extensive prior environmental knowledge, such techniques tend to be data-hungry. We propose a physics-based data-driven acoustic propagation modeling approach that enables us to train models with only a small amount of data. The proposed modeling framework is not only data-efficient, but also offers flexibility to incorporate varying degrees of environmental knowledge, and generalizes well to permit extrapolation beyond the area where data were collected.

**Example:**
If you have a set of measured pressure amplitudes and their corresponding measurement locations as training and validation data, you can load them directly. The location data should be a matrix with dimension [dimension of a single location data x number of data points]. The field data should be a matrix with dimension [1 x number of data points].

Alternatively, you have the option to utilize the propagation models available in `Undertwateracoustic.jl`, `AcousticRayTracers.jl` or `AcousticsToolbox.jl` to generate synthetic acoustic data.

Here, we use a  7-rays `PekerisRayModel` to generate synthetic acoustic measurements and ground truth fields within an area of interest and an extended region:
```julia
julia> using UnderwaterAcoustics
julia> using DataDrivenAcoustics
julia> using Plots

julia> env = UnderwaterEnvironment();
julia> pm = PekerisRayModel(env,7);
```

We assume an omnidirectional 1 kHz transmitter `tx` at a depth of 5 m at the origin. We sample modeled acoustic measurements `tloss` from `pm` at 500 random locations `rxpos` covering an 80 m x 20 m area of interest. Those 500 measurements are used to train our physics-based data-driven propagation model. We seed the random generator to allow reader replicate the following results[^1].
[^1]: The presented results are obtained using Julia version 1.7.3.
```julia
julia> using Random
julia> Random.seed!(1);
julia> tx = AcousticSource(0.0, -5.0, 1000.0);
julia> rxpos = rand(2, 500) .* [80.0, -20.0] .+ [1.0, 0.0];
julia> tloss = Array{Float32}(undef, 1, size(rxpos)[2]);
julia> for i in 1 : 1 : size(rxpos)[2]
          tloss[1, i] = Float32(transmissionloss(pm, AcousticSource(txpos[1], txpos[2], 1000.0), AcousticReceiver(rxpos[1,i], rxpos[2,i]); mode=:coherent))
       end
```

We plot measurement locations on top of ground truth field pattern. Note that the region from a range of 80 m to 100 m is the extended region where no measurement data are taken.

```julia
julia> rx = AcousticReceiverGrid2D(1.0, 0.1, 1000, -20.0, 0.1, 200);

julia> let x = transmissionloss(pm, tx, rx)
  plot(env; receivers = rx, transmissionloss = x, title = "Ground truth", clim = (-40,0))
  scatter!(rxpos[1,:], rxpos[2,:]; markersize = 1.5, markercolor =:green, markerstrokewidth = 0)
  xlims!(0, 100)
  ylims!(-20, 0)
end
```
![](docs/images/groundtruth.png)

We plot the measurement locations with scaled size and color for better visualization:
```julia 
julia> let s = clamp.(vec(-tloss) ./ 40 .+ 1, 0.0, 1.0) .* 4 .+ 1
    plot(rxpos[1,:], rxpos[2,:]; zcolor = vec(-tloss), seriestype=:scatter, clim = (-40, 0), markersize = s, markerstrokewidth = 0, label = nothing, title = "Data", xlabel = "x (m)", ylabel = "z (m)")
    xlims!(0, 100)
    ylims!(-20, 0)
end
```
![](docs/images/data.png)


Now you can define a data-driven underwater environment by providing locations, measurements and any known environmental or geometric parameters as inputs:

```julia
julia> dataenv = DataDrivenUnderwaterEnvironment(RX, TL; frequency = 1000.0, soundspeed = 1540.0);
```

You need to formulate a ray basis neural network (RBNN) model that best suits the given scenario. Currently, this package offers four predefined RBNN formulations, as mentioned earlier. There are three data-driven models capable of handing this specific environment `dataenv`:
```julia
julia> models(dataenv)
3-element Vector{Any}:
 RayBasis2D
 RayBasis2DCurv
 GPR
```

Users have the flexibility to define their own RBNN formulations tailored to the specific environment. As an illustrative example, we utilize the RayBasis2DCurv formulation.

```julia
julia> datapm = RayBasis2DCurv(dataenv; inilearnrate = 0.005, seed = true);
```
This line of code automates the search and random initialization for trainable parameters of the defined RBNN model, allowing the model to learn from data and return a model with optimized trainable parameters.

To query field at an unvisited location, simply call the `transmissionloss` with trained RBNN model `datapm` and a location coordinate:
```julia
julia> transmissionloss(datapm, nothing, AcousticReceiver(50.0, -10.0))
 30.47255541988299
```
Note that source location is optional in transmission loss calculation for data driven propagation models.


You can plot the estimated field patterns within the area of interest and the extended region:
```julia
julia> let x = transmissionloss(datapm, nothing, rx)
          plot(env; receivers = rx, transmissionloss = x, title = "RBNN", clim = (-40,0))
          xlims!(0, 100)
          ylims!(-20, 0)
       end
```
![](docs/images/estimation.png)
Our proposed physics-based data-driven propagation modeling technique has the capability not only to interpolate but also to extrapolate.



You can ask for the significant arrivals[^2]:
```julia
>julia arrivals(datapm, nothing, AcousticReceiver(50, -10))

56-element Vector{DataDrivenAcoustics.RayArrival{Missing, ComplexF64}}:
                         |          | -33.9 dB ϕ -68.6°
                         |          | -34.3 dB ϕ-146.7°
                         |          | -36.0 dB ϕ 155.4°
                         |          | -36.4 dB ϕ -51.1°
                         |          | -36.9 dB ϕ -29.0°
                         |          | -37.0 dB ϕ -88.1°
 ⋮
                         |          | -60.6 dB ϕ 152.6°
                         |          | -62.5 dB ϕ -88.7°
                         |          | -62.5 dB ϕ  55.4°
                         |          | -62.6 dB ϕ -57.2°
                         |          | -62.7 dB ϕ-169.1°
```
The empty columns represent information that is not provided by data-driven models.

[^2]: Significant arrivals refers to arrivals with amplitudes no smaller than maximum arrival amplitude minus `threshold`. Threshold is a optional argument in `arrivals` and its default value is set to 30 dB.


For benchmarking, we constrcut a Guassian process regression model using `GPR` given a kernal. To take advantage of the kernels available in the `GaussianProcesses.jl` package, please ensure that you have installed it.

```julia
julia> using GaussianProcesses;
julia> kern = Matern(1/2, 0.0, 0.0);
julia> gp = GPR(dataenv, kern; logObsNoise = -5.0, seed = true, ratioₜ = 1.0);
julia> let x = transmissionloss(gp, nothing, rx)
          plot(dataenv; receivers = rx, transmissionloss = x, clims=(-40,0), title = "Gaussian Processes")
          xlims!(0, 100)
          ylims!(-20, 0)
      end
```
![](docs/images/GPR.png)
The Gaussian process model can recover key strcuture in field pattern with low fidelity, but fail to extrapolate beyond the measurement region.

Note that we utilize 100% of the data (500 measurements) as training data to train the GPR model, as the ratioₜ in GPR is set to 1.0 by default. Our RBNN model, on the other hand, is trained using 350 measurements, while the remaining 150 measurements are used as validation data for early stopping. The provided kernel and hyperparameters yield the best estimated field pattern (determined through visual inspection, as we know the ground truth field pattern) among the various kernels and hyperparameters we experimented with for this specific example. If users lack prior information about the ground truth field pattern, they should allocate some validation data for hyperparameter tuning of the GPR model.
